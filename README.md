# Mega-COV
A billion-scale dataset from Twitter for studying COVID-19. The dataset is diverse (covers 234 countries), longitudinal (goes as back as 2007), multilingual (comes in 65 languages), and has a significant number of location-tagged tweets (~32M tweets). We release tweet IDs from the dataset, hoping it will be useful for studying various phenomena related to the ongoing pandemic and accelerating viable solutions to associated problems.
